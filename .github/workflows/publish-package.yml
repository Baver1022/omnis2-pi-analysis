      # NOTE: Publishing to GitHub Packages is currently disabled
      # because GITHUB_TOKEN doesn't work with PyPI endpoint (https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/)
      # GitHub Packages for Python uses PyPI-compatible API, but requires
      # a different authentication method or endpoint
      #
      # TODO: Find the correct way to publish Python packages to GitHub Packages
      # Possible solutions:
      # 1. Use GitHub Packages API directly (if available)
      # 2. Use a different tool or method
      # 3. Configure package differently
      #
      # For now, the package is built but not published
      # You can manually publish it through GitHub UI or find the correct endpoint
