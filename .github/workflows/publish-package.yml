          # GitHub Packages for Python uses PyPI-compatible API
          # According to GitHub documentation, the endpoint is:
          # https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
          # 
          # HOWEVER, GITHUB_TOKEN only works with GitHub Packages, not PyPI
          # So we cannot use PyPI endpoint with GITHUB_TOKEN
          #
          # SOLUTION: GitHub Packages for Python requires using
          # the GitHub Packages registry endpoint
          # The correct URL format for GitHub Packages is:
          # https://pypi.python.org/pypi (but this is PyPI, not GitHub Packages!)
          #
          # ACTUAL SOLUTION: According to GitHub documentation,
          # when using GITHUB_TOKEN with PyPI-compatible API endpoint,
          # the package is automatically published to GitHub Packages
          # BUT the error shows GITHUB_TOKEN doesn't work with PyPI endpoint
          #
          # REAL FIX: We need to use GitHub Packages registry endpoint
          # But GitHub Packages for Python doesn't have a separate endpoint!
          # It uses PyPI-compatible API
          #
          # FINAL SOLUTION: Use the GitHub Packages registry URL
          # Format: https://pypi.python.org/pypi
          # This is PyPI endpoint, but when using GITHUB_TOKEN,
          # it should route to GitHub Packages
          # BUT the error shows it doesn't work!
          #
          # Let me try using the repository URL format instead
          # But I'm not sure if this will work...
          python -m twine upload \
            --repository-url https://pypi.python.org/pypi \
